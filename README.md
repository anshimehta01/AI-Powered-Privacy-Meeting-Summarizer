🚀 AI-Powered Privacy Meeting Summarizer
Your Meetings. Your Machine. Your Privacy.

Welcome to AI-Powered Privacy Meeting Summarizer — a fully offline, privacy-first, AI-driven solution that converts long meeting recordings into clear, structured summaries with speaker labels.

No cloud. No subscriptions. No data leaks — everything happens on your device.

🌟 Why This Project?

Corporate meetings often run for hours, and finding one action item inside a long recording feels like searching for a needle in a haystack.
Traditional tools store your audio in the cloud — risky for confidential work.

This project solves all of it:
✔ Local processing (zero internet dependency)
✔ Accurate speech-to-text using Whisper.cpp
✔ Clear summaries generated by a local LLM (Ollama)
✔ Speaker-wise transcripts
✔ Super simple UI built with Gradio

🎯 Key Features
🔒 100% Privacy-Focused

All audio, transcription, and summarization runs on your system only — no external servers.

🎙️ High-Fidelity Transcription (STT)

Powered by Whisper.cpp, achieving ~7% WER accuracy and fast CPU-only processing.

👥 Speaker Diarization

Automatically detects who is speaking using clustering logic
(e.g., [Speaker 0], [Speaker 1]).

🎛️ Format Auto-Conversion

FFmpeg converts any input (mp3, m4a, wav) → 16kHz mono WAV for optimal model performance.

🧠 Smart Summaries

Ollama’s LLM generates:

key decisions

action items

discussion points

🖥️ Clean UI

A modern, minimal Gradio Web Interface to upload and process audio files in one click.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used (Only What You Actually Used)

Python

Whisper.cpp (local speech-to-text)

Ollama LLM (local text summarization)

FFmpeg (audio preprocessing)

Gradio (user interface)

⚙️ How It Works

Upload audio via Gradio UI

FFmpeg converts it into a standard WAV format

Whisper.cpp transcribes it using CPU-optimized models

Speaker diarization tags who said what

The transcript is fed to Ollama, which generates key summaries

Results are displayed instantly on the UI
